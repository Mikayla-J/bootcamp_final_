# bootcamp_final_
Final project for Black Disruptor Accelerator
Through the analysis of the data I wanted to determine the following:

1 – To Join the retail customers and retail transactions data to cross reference sales by customer unique ID.

2 – To identify the amount of transitions by gender.

3 – To identify the number of Personal Appliances sold with a breakdown of the sales amount, total tax and units sold.

4 – To identify the top selling products of clothing for women spent by women.

5 – To identify the type of store that are producing the most returns to determine the positive and negative ratio on returns.

6 – Visualisation of the following: Units sold by product category and subcategory, total tax paid in each store type and the total amount sold between 2011 and 2014
